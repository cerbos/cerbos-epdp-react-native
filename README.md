# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Cerbos Embedded (WebView)

This app includes a simple demo that runs `@cerbos/embedded-client` inside a `react-native-webview` and uses `postMessage` to invoke methods (`checkResource`, `checkResources`, `planResources`) from the React Native UI.

- UI: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- WebView bridge + RPC: `components/cerbos-embedded-webview.tsx`

### How it works

- The WebView loads a static HTML asset that references a bundled bridge script (includes `@cerbos/embedded-client`) and uses a bundled copy of the Cerbos WASM binary from `@cerbos/embedded-server`.
- On iOS/Android, the WASM is read from the app bundle and uploaded to the WebView in chunks (to avoid a single huge `postMessage` payload).
- The React Native side sends JSON-RPC-like messages to the WebView, and the WebView replies with the result (or a serialized error).
- There is no CDN/network fallback for the SDK or WASM (only the Hub policy fetch uses the network).

### Options and callbacks

`app/(tabs)/index.tsx` lets you provide:

- Embedded client options as JSON (e.g. `schemaEnforcement`, `globals`, `headers`, `userAgent`, `onValidationError`).
- Policy loader options as JSON (e.g. `scopes`, `interval`, `activateOnLoad`).
- Native callback handlers (e.g. `onDecision`, `onValidationError`, `decodeJWTPayload`, policy `onUpdate`) that are registered locally and invoked from the WebView via `postMessage`.

### Running the demo

1. Start the app (`npx expo start`) and open the Home tab.
2. Enter your Cerbos Hub `ruleId` (and optionally Hub client credentials).
3. Tap **Init Embedded Client**, then run **checkResource**, **checkResources**, or **planResources**.

Note: the device/emulator running the app must be able to reach the Hub API.

### Production notes

- The WebView bridge bundle and HTML are generated by `npm run build:webview-assets` (also runs on `postinstall`) into `assets/cerbos/bridge.bundle` and `assets/cerbos/bridge.html`.
- The WebView loads local file assets; `components/cerbos-embedded-webview.tsx` stages them into a cache directory so the HTML can reference the bundled JS by relative path.
- Don’t hardcode Hub credentials in the app; use a secure provisioning mechanism appropriate for your threat model.

## Using this in your own React Native app

This repo is intended as a reference implementation: it runs `@cerbos/embedded-client` inside a WebView, and your React Native UI talks to it over `postMessage`.

### 1) Install dependencies

At a minimum you’ll need:

```bash
npm i @cerbos/embedded-client @cerbos/embedded-server @cerbos/core react-native-webview
npm i -D esbuild
```

If you’re using Expo, also ensure you have:

```bash
npx expo install expo-asset expo-file-system
```

If you reuse the demo `decodeJWTPayload` helper, install the fast base64 helper too:

```bash
npm i react-native-quick-base64
```

### 2) Bundle `@cerbos/embedded-client` for the WebView

The WebView can’t import from your native bundle directly, so this demo bundles the Embedded client and bridge into a single JS asset referenced by a tiny HTML page:

- Entry for the WebView bridge: `scripts/cerbos-webview-bridge.ts`
- Shared bridge types: `components/cerbos-embedded-bridge-types.ts` (update the import path if you place it elsewhere)
- Build script that writes `assets/cerbos/bridge.bundle` and `assets/cerbos/bridge.html`: `scripts/build-cerbos-webview-assets.mjs`
- Hook it up (for example) via `package.json` `postinstall` like this repo does.

Make sure Metro treats `.html` and `.bundle` as assets (Expo example from this repo):

```js
// metro.config.js
config.resolver.assetExts = Array.from(new Set([...config.resolver.assetExts, 'wasm', 'html', 'bundle']));
```

Then build the assets and either commit them or keep the `postinstall` hook:

```bash
npm run build:webview-assets
```

### 3) Ensure the Cerbos WASM is bundled

This demo imports the WASM from `@cerbos/embedded-server/lib/server.wasm` and uploads it to the WebView at runtime.
You must configure Metro to include `.wasm` as an asset (see above), and ensure your app packaging includes it.

### 4) Add the WebView bridge to your app

Copy `components/cerbos-embedded-webview.tsx` into your project and render it once (it can be visually hidden).
Also copy `components/cerbos-embedded-bridge-types.ts` so the shared types stay consistent between the native app and the WebView bundle.
Then call `init()` and the RPC methods through its ref:

Note: the WebView loads local files; the component sets `allowFileAccess`, `allowFileAccessFromFileURLs`, `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`, and `allowingReadAccessToURL` so the HTML can load the bundled script.

```tsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";
import type { CheckResourceRequest } from "@cerbos/core";
import { CerbosEmbeddedWebView, type CerbosWebViewHandle } from "./components/cerbos-embedded-webview";

const webViewRef = useRef<CerbosWebViewHandle>(null);

// render somewhere near the root
<CerbosEmbeddedWebView ref={webViewRef} containerStyle={{ position: "absolute", width: 1, height: 1, opacity: 0 }} style={{ width: 1, height: 1 }} />

// later…
await webViewRef.current?.init({
  ruleId: "YOUR_HUB_RULE_ID",
  hubClientId: process.env.CERBOS_HUB_CLIENT_ID,
  hubClientSecret: process.env.CERBOS_HUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
  hubBaseUrl: "https://api.cerbos.cloud",
  policyOptions: { interval: 60, activateOnLoad: true, scopes: [] },
  options: { schemaEnforcement: "warn", lenientScopeSearch: false },
  callbacks: {
    onDecision: (entry) => console.log("decision", entry),
    onPolicyUpdate: (err) => console.log("policy update", err),
  },
});

const req: CheckResourceRequest = { /* ... */ };
const res = await webViewRef.current?.checkResource(req);
```

If you want the “provider + tabs” architecture from this demo, see `components/cerbos-epdp-context.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/*`.
