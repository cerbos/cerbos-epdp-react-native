# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Cerbos Embedded (WebView)

This app includes a simple demo that runs `@cerbos/embedded-client` inside a `react-native-webview` and uses `postMessage` to invoke methods (currently `checkResource`) from the React Native UI.

- UI: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- WebView bridge + RPC: `components/cerbos-embedded-webview.tsx`

### How it works

- The WebView loads a tiny HTML page (inline) that evals a bundled copy of `@cerbos/embedded-client` (generated locally) and uses a bundled copy of the Cerbos WASM binary from `@cerbos/embedded-server`.
- On iOS/Android, the WASM is read from the app bundle and uploaded to the WebView in chunks (to avoid a single huge `postMessage` payload).
- The React Native side sends JSON-RPC-like messages to the WebView, and the WebView replies with the result (or a serialized error).
 - There is no CDN/network fallback for the SDK or WASM (only the Hub policy fetch uses the network).

### Running the demo

1. Start the app (`npx expo start`) and open the Home tab.
2. Enter your Cerbos Hub `ruleId` (and optionally Hub client credentials).
3. Tap **Init Embedded Client**, then **Run checkResource**.

Note: the device/emulator running the app must be able to reach the Hub API and the WASM URL you configured.

### Production notes

- The WebView SDK bundle is generated by `npm run build:webview-assets` (also runs on `postinstall`) into `assets/cerbos/embedded-client.bundle.txt`.
- Don’t hardcode Hub credentials in the app; use a secure provisioning mechanism appropriate for your threat model.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
